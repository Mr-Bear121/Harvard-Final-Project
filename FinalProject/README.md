#### Description:
This is a basic time recording website. Once logged in or registered, the homepage immediately takes you to a submission form that contains the current date and time.
once you press the submit button, it will send the information to a database called Chrono.db in my data folder.
This folder contains 2 tables. one for useraccounts and 1 for your timesheet. If you look at the nav of the website, you have the option of either navigating
to your timesheet to review your time or go back to the homepage to submit a new time. You also have the option to logout.
Having a basic timesheet plotted out can, "in future" lead to creating an app for your phone or even adding features and creating a business around your
specific take on time management.
